# Implementation Guidelines
*Ver. 0.1*

**Note: These guidelines are the first version and are subject to change.**

## Structure

1. There will be **a repository for each paper we read**. We have already created the first one - a_tutorial_on_pca. 
2. If you want to make your own implementation, the best way is to **create a folder or file** (if it’s a single file implementation) in the dedicated repository **with you name** (slack name, nickname - whatever you like). 
3. **If you’re developing in your own repo**, it’s also ok - just add the link to the readme.md page of the related repository 

## Implementation 
1. There are **no restrictions on the programming language**. It would be quite cool to read PCA with Lua, to be honest :)
2. There are **no restrictions on the methods** you use. It’s even ok if you use library method and focus on visualisation. Whatever. We have different backgrounds, so anything goes (as long as it is related to the paper’s topic). 
2. It is okay (and even great) if you decide to implement just a part of some method.


**Summary: just do something and share! :)**
